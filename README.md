# Translation Requirements üìù

 I'm more than happy to include your translations for acutebot. Please stick to these requirements for minimal errors!
 
## What you need to do:

- **The files that you'll need to use are .yaml files, these can be edited in any basic text editor. Notepad++ and Atom are recommended for desktops. If you happen to want to translate on an Android mobile device, check out [acode](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.foxdebug.acodefree) editor.**

- **The base file is `en.yaml`. Once downloaded, rename it with your language's [ISO 639-1 code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes).**

- **The two letter one is recommended, translate the parts in the quotation marks `"..."` and everything below `|`. Refer [here](https://github.com/starry69/acutebot-translations/blob/f0d71ff2e71a8272357c0207b6223e0a24161798/Strings/en.yaml#L199) and [here](https://github.com/starry69/acutebot-translations/blob/f0d71ff2e71a8272357c0207b6223e0a24161798/Strings/en.yaml#L92).**

- **In the case of use quotation marks in Strings, escape them using a single backslash like this: `\"` .**

- **Do not modify curly brackets and leave HTML tags like `<b>{}</b>` untouched, as acutebot is using Telegram's Bot API HTML formatting. Refer to their API Documentation [here](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api#html-style).**

- **After you are finished, you can either make a Pull Request in this repo or can contact me on [Telegram](https://t.me/starryboi) with your translation file!**

<!-- > Why am I not using Crowdin or POEditor for this? -->

### Happy translating üéâ
